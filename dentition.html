                <p>The overall appearance of Ar. <em>ramidus</em> molars are more similar to the chimpanzees of today than Australopithecus <em>afarensis</em> (Lucy), who lived only 1 million years later than Ar. <em>ramidus</em>.</p>

                <p>Both the distal and buccal (inside and outside) edges of the molars are bowl-shaped. </p>
                <p>The molars have less enamel thickness than chimpanzees, but more than Australopiths. The thickness suggests two things: that Ar. <em>ramidus</em> is an intermediary between chimpanzees and other pre-human hominids, and that their diets included more meats than chimpanees.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Ar. <em>ramidus</em> has a flatter jaw attatchment point, or articular eminence.</p>

                <p>Ar. <em>ramidus</em> has larger canines than Australopiths, including A. <em>afarensis.</em> 
                    The canines are more in line with the pre-molars, which is different from A. <em>afarensis</em>, whose canines are more rotated mesiodistally (with the inside edge of the canine towards the tongue) [See above photos].<br><br>This feature is found in “more primitive” apes according to Dr. Tim D. White, and suggests that the canine was not incorporated into the function of the incisors in Ardi.<br><br>The canines have a different thickness than both chimpanzees and Australopiths.</p>
