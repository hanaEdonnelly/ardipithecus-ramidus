                <h2>Dentition</h2>
                <p>Dr. Tim D. White and his Middle Awash research team decided on the classification of Ar. <em>ramidus</em> as a whole new species based on solely dentition at first.<br><br>What were some of the things that allowed his team to make this classification?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Molars</h2>
                <p>The overall appearance of Ar. <em>ramidus</em> molars are more similar to the chimpanzees of today than to molars of more recently fossilized hominins (like Lucy).</p>
            </div>
            <img src="tooth-comparisons.jpg" alt="A report by the archaeologists at Aramis from 1994 shows tooth comparisons between Ar. ramidus and other hominins.">
            <p class="caption">Decidious first molar comparisons... show a wide separation between the dm1 of Aramis and those of other early hominid species.<br>a, Dryopithecus; b, Pan paniscus; c, Pan troglodytes; <u>d, Australopithecus ramidus (APA-VP-1/129);</u> e, A. afarensis (Lucy); f, A. africanus (Tuang); g, A. robustus; h, A. boisei; i, Homo sapiens (modern).</p>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Both the distal and buccal (inside and outside) edges of the molars are bowl-shaped. </p>
                <p>The molars have less enamel thickness than chimpanzees, but more than Australopiths. The thickness suggests two things: that Ar. <em>ramidus</em> is an intermediary between chimpanzees and other pre-human hominids, and that their diets included softer foods than chimpanees.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Ar. <em>ramidus</em> has a flatter jaw attatchment point, or articular eminence than chimpanzees. This, again, implies they ate softer foods than modern chimps, as modern chimps need more muscle for chewing rougher foods.</p>

                <p>The shape of Ar. <em>ramidus</em>'s jaw is between the chimp and Australopith shape, with a move from a V-shape to a U-shape.<br><br>The molars are large like chimps, with buccal asymmetry somehwere betweens chimps and Australopiths.</p>

                <h2>Incisors and canines</h2>
                <p>The incisoral size is between a chimp and Australopith.<br><br>Ar. <em>ramidus</em> has larger canines than Australopiths, including A. <em>afarensis.</em> 
                    The canines are more in line with the pre-molars, which is different from A. <em>afarensis</em>, whose canines are more rotated mesiodistally (with the inside edge of the canine towards the tongue) [See above photos].<br><br>This feature is found in “more primitive” apes according to Dr. Tim D. White, and suggests that the canine was not incorporated into the function of the incisors in Ardi.<br><br>The canines have a different thickness than both chimpanzees and Australopiths.<br><br>Dr. Tim D. White, Gen Suwa, and other researchers propose that canine sexual dimorphism was human-like.</p>
