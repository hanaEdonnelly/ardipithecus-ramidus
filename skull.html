                <h2>Dentition</h2>
                <p>When Gen Suwa discovered the hominin tooth in Ethiopia, researchers found that some of the molar's features were unique from other hominins found prior.</p>
                <p>The overall appearance of Ar. <em>ramidus</em> molars are more similar to the chimpanzees of today than Australopithecus <em>afarensis</em> (Lucy), who lived only 1 million years later than Ar. <em>ramidus</em>.</p>

                <p>The 3rd molar is more asymmetrical than Australopiths and humans.</p>
                <p>The buccal side of the molars (towards the cheek) are flatter than later hominins, but more bowl-shaped than chimpanzees.<br><br>Distally (on the inside as the teeth go around the jaw), the molars are more bowl-shaped than chimpanzees.</p>
                <p>The molars have less enamel thickness than other apes. The thickness suggests two things: that Ar. <em>ramidus</em> is an intermediary between chimpanzees and other pre-human hominids, and that their diets were more diverse than chimpanzees. Because of the amount of chewing obligate vegetarian apes require, they need thicker enamel.</p>
                <p>Ar. <em>ramidus</em> has a flatter jaw attatchment point, or articular eminence.</p>

                <p>Ar. <em>ramidus</em> has larger canines than Australopiths, including A. <em>afarensis.</em> 
                    The canines are more in line with the pre-molars, which is different from A. <em>afarensis</em>, whose canines are more rotated mesiodistally (with the inside edge of the canine towards the tongue).<br><br>his feature is found in “more primitive” apes according to Dr. Tim D. White, and suggests that the canine was not incorporated into the function of the incisors in Ardi. Ardi has molar thickness more similar to chimpanzees than A. afarensis too.</p>

                <h2>Skull</h2>
                <p>Other features on Ar. <em>ramidus</em>’s skull that distinguish it include the placement of the foramen magnum on the underside and shortened basioccipital area (the raised part around the foramen magnum).</p>

                <p>Both of these features indicate upright posture in Ar. ramidus. These are both derived traits shared with modern humans. Both traits indicate bipedalism in Ar. ramidus. (makes the skull easier to carry with the spine, less reliant on neck muscles)</p>
