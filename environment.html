                <h2>Grassy woodslands or wooded grasslands?</h2>
                <p>For years, researchers have debated what kind of environment Ar. <em>ramidus</em> lived in.<br><br>They had an idea of what kind of animals lived in the area based on soil analyses. They also knew that Ardi's fossil had traits like a moveable big toe and long pelvis allowing for adept climbing. But they weren't sure where, or if, the savanna theory of bipedalism fit in.

                <h2>Theory 1: Wooded grasslands</h2>
                <p>The group of researchers supporting this theory propose that the Middle Awash was an arid, grassy savanna with sparse tree growth.<br><br>This group of researchers did analyses on soils, finding remains from grasses. They determined that 40-60% of the ground was covered in grasses, fitting the definition of African vegetation by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization.<br><br>Additionally, geochemist Thure Cerling of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City says Aramis soil samples showed the ground to be too arid to support more than a thin forest.<br><br>Overall, these researchers believe that Ar. ramidus and Aramis support the savanna-origin theory of bipedlism.

                <h2>Theory 2: Grassy woodlands</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, researchers at the Middle Awash research group believe that, while Aramis had areas of grasses, that Ar <em>ramidus</em> lived its life in the forest.<br><br>In 2010, Dr. Tim D. White said, "We're not focusing on the places Ardi would have seen during her life... Rather, what we're trying to understand is which part of that environment this big primate preferred as its habitatâ€”its address, where it lived."<br><br>His Middle Awash research group studied isotopes in fossilized teeth from Ar. <em>ramidus</em> and other  mammals to compare their diets.<br><br>They found that Ar. <em>ramidus</em> had a more similar diet to woodland animals in the area. Additionally, they determined that the shape of Ar. <em>ramidus</em> teeth implies a diet of woodland plants and fruits.</p>
